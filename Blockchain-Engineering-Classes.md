| [Organizing JavaScript Functionality August 2015](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/organizing-javascript/) | No amount of learning the theory of JavaScript will substitute for actually practicing the implementation of it. Even before you adopt a framework, learning how to organize the different bits of JavaScript (modularizing, decoupling, etc) will make a huge positive impact on the quality of your code. Once you've mastered those techniques, turn your attention to building code that you can share between the client (browser) and the server (Node). That's where the most exciting exercises of your new-found JS knowledge will shine!| Beginner/Intermediate | Developers | 5 hours |
| [Four Semesters of Computer Science in 5 Hours July 2016](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/computer-science/) | We're going to tackle some big topics in just five hours: Algorithms and Big O Analysis, Recursion, Sorting, Data Structures and Functional Programming. What? Is that even possible? We're sure as hell going to try! Since many of us are self taught and/or dropouts (myself included) we lack the advantages that a formal CS education can give. This additional theory can give us useful context to make tradeoffs in implementations and architectures.| All | All | 4.75 hours |
